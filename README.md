# grid-2d 
[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/grid-2d.svg)](https://clojars.org/grid-2d)

A simple 2d grid library that operates on nested clojure vectors. Designed to be easy to use and to interoperate easily with the standard library. As a result may be slow compared to libraries that use native 2d arrays or other specialist representations.
